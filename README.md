# Submarine Sonar Signal Analysis: Rock or Mine Detection

This project uses sonar signals to determine whether an object is a rock or a mine. It leverages **logistic regression** and basic concepts in **NumPy** and **Pandas**. The dataset for this project can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

## **Steps to Implement**

### 1. Import Necessary Libraries
   - Use libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, and `sklearn`.

### 2. Load the Dataset
   - Import the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

### 3. Separate Features and Labels
   - Split the dataset into `X` (features) and `y` (labels).

### 4. Train-Test Split
   - Use `train_test_split` from `sklearn` to divide the dataset into training and testing sets.

### 5. Train the Model
   - Train the logistic regression model on the training data (`X_train` and `y_train`).

### 6. Evaluate Training Accuracy
   - Calculate the training accuracy, which is generally higher than the testing accuracy.

### 7. Test the Model
   - Test the model on unseen data (`X_test`) and evaluate its performance.

### 8. Check Testing Accuracy
   - If the accuracy is above 70%, the model is performing well. Otherwise, consider adding more data or features.

### 9. Build a Predictive System
   - Test the model with random inputs to check if predictions are correct.

### 10. Finalize the Model
   - Once the model performs well, it's ready for deployment.
